● MyMap: associate() and find()

associate():
The runtime of my associate function is O(logN), where N is the number of Key/Value pairs in the map.

find():
The runtime of my find function is O(logN), where N is the number of Key/Value pairs in the map.


● AttractionMapper: init(), getGeoCoord()

init():
If there are N segments and a total of A attractions, the function runs in O(N*A*logA) time.

getGeoCoord():
If there are A attractions, getGeoCoord runs in O(logA) time.


● SegmentMapper: init(), getSegments()

init():
If N is the number of segments and A is the total number of attractions, the runtime of this function is O((N+A)*log(N+A)).

getSegments():
If N is the number of segments and A is the total number of attractions, the runtime of this function is O(log(N+A)).


● Navigator: navigate()

navigate():
If N is the number of segments and A is the total number of attractions, the runtime of this function is O((A+N)*log(A+N)).
